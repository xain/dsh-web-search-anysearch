[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-08

Compatibility fixes for harness API changes.

### Changed

- Migrated settings registration from the removed `installSettingsSection` / `settingsNamespace` helpers to the current `ctx.settings.installSection` + a plain string namespace, matching the shipped `web-search-deepseek` provider. The package now loads on harness versions that removed the old helpers.
- Migrated the browser half's credential writes to `ctx.remote.credentials` with positional arguments (`set(ref, value)` / `describe([ref])` / `unset(ref)`), matching the shipped web-search controller, so saving the API key and options is accepted by the current harness.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-17

Packaging fixes for npm publication readiness.

### Changed

- Changed the npm package name from `@dsh-external/dsh-web-search-anysearch` to `dsh-web-search-anysearch`.
- Tightened DSH peer dependency ranges to the `0.1.0-rc.6` working train.
- Updated installer/uninstaller scripts and the client bundle identity to the new package name.
